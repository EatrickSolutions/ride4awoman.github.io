                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <h3>Evelyne And Denis</h3>
                <p>Ride 4 a Woman is a charitable organization set up to empower women socially and economically in the local community of Bwindi, Uganda. The organization supports women who are struggling with poverty, HIV and domestic violence, and single mothers, widows and women who never went to school, carrying out many projects with a huge impact into their lives.</p>
                <p>Ride 4 a Woman was set up in 2009 by Evelyne Habasa and her husband Denis Rubalema. Evelyne grew up in the local community where the organization is established, and was inspired by her mother since she was very young. Her mother sacrificed a lot to put her eight children through school as she had no money to afford the basics. She owned one dress, a pretty red one, and she washed it every night so she could wear it again the next day. Her red dress was “the talk of the village”. Her frugality and very hard work managed to put all her children through good schools. This is the struggle most women go through every day in this community and what motivated Evelyne to start Ride 4 a Woman.</p>
                <p> The organization started by renting bicycles to tourists who like riding. The money collected went directly to support local women struggling with issues associated with poverty, HIV and domestic violence. This is why the name “Ride 4 a Woman” came about: riding to support the women.</p>
                <p>In 2011, Evelyne met Patricia, a woman from Australia, who came for Gorilla tracking. Patricia wanted to buy fabrics in Uganda to take back home to do quilting, and Evelyne help her by being her translator. When Patricia went back home, in Australia, she sent pictures of her quilting products to Evelyne. Evelyne loved them and thought that it would be great if the women of Ride 4 a Woman learned to sew. This would allow the organization to make its own handmade products, sell them and get more money to support  more women.</p>
                <p>In 2012, the 16 pioneer women of the organization were trained to sew and weave by Patricia and two of her friends. After, these 16 women were the ones who started teaching many more women around the community through the “train the trainer” methodology.</p>
                <p>More than 100 women were trained in total, and every day 60 of them work at Ride 4 a Woman center, making the handmade products that are sold in the shop of the organization. Apart from working, these 60 women find in Ride 4 a Woman a space of safety and support, a meal is provided to them and earn a salary that is given to them every two weeks.
Ride 4 a Woman has a total of 300 members, all of them are women from the 11 villages in Bwindi who benefit from the organization.</p>
                <p>The organization leads many different projects to empower women and improve people’s lives in the local community: microfinancing their entrepreneurial ideas, sponsoring the education of many children, providing safe water for all the community, installing solar panels in homes without electricity, among others. You can read more about our projects through the top main menu of the website.</p>
                <p>Every day we welcome visitors to stay with us, learn from us while doing the activities we offer, shop or simply drop by to see what is going on. If you are visiting Bwindi, come and stay with us in our accommodation and restaurant, and learn about our culture and traditions while supporting our mission. We will be honored to welcome you at home.</p>

            <p>Ride 4 a Woman is a Ugandan non-governmental organization set up to empower women socially and economically in our local community, in Bwindi, Uganda.</p>
            
            <p>Sustainability is at the core of Ride 4 a Woman. We are located at the edge of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, home to half of the world's mountain gorilla population. We are very aware of the importance of conserving the national park, the gorillas and other species of fauna and flora, and the surrounding areas of the park, where people live in. We believe that a good life for people while respecting the biodiversity and ecosystems of our planet is possible and necessary. It is our duty to make it a reality.</p>
            
            <p>Since Ride 4 a Woman was founded in 2009, all the efforts of the organization have always focused on improving people's lives and protecting our planet. Empowering women is our reason for being, and sustainability is the only way to make it possible.</p>
            
            <p>To finance our social projects, in Ride 4 a Woman we welcome visitors and tourists to our center every day. We offer a wide range of services to tourists who visit Bwindi, most of them interested in tracking the mountain gorillas in the national park. We offer accommodation, restaurant and cafeteria services, activities to learn about Ugandan traditions and culture and our craft shop where visitors can buy any of the handmade products made by the women of the organization. Ride 4 a Woman, then, is a social enterprise immersed in the tourism sector, and we work to make this sector a sustainable industry in Uganda.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sdg-intro">
            <p>In 2015, the world agreed on the need of establishing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guide the individuals, organizations and governments towards the most important challenges that we face as humanity. At Ride 4 a Woman, the SDGs guide us in the different fields of sustainability. We are very proud of the positive impact that we have, through our daily work, on 10 of the 17 SDGs. We've split them in 3 groups depending on the repercussion that Ride 4 a Woman has on each of them: very highly, highly and moderately impacted SDGs.</p>

                        <p>Almost half of the Ugandan population lives on less than $2.15 a day (being $2.15/day the International Poverty Line, according to the World Bank). In Ride 4 a Woman we fight against poverty by empowering women from our community who are struggling with poverty, HIV and domestic violence, are single mothers, widows or women who never went to school. To do so, the organization employs 60 women with the mentioned profiles who come to work every day at our center. These women were taught to pedal sew and weave, and they are the ones who make the handmade products that are sold in our craft shop.</p>
                        <p>Ride 4 a Woman has 300 members and supports them, their families and many more people from the community to combat poverty through all our projects: Employing women, Children sponsorship, Light a home, Goats program, Microfinance, Safe water, Agriculture, and Building a home.</p>

                        <p>In Uganda and in our community, there are many children who don't go to school (usually because of economic reasons) and the percentages of people who cannot read and write are still very high. In Ride 4 a Woman, we work to put as many children as possible into schools, and we do it through our children sponsorship program. Nowadays, more than 270 children, from families who cannot afford paying school fees, go to school thanks to Ride 4 a Woman. We make sure to pay school fees on time and to provide uniforms and school supplies to the kids, so that they can focus all their attention on what really matters to them: studying and learning.</p>
                        <p>But Ride 4 a Woman doesn't stop here. Our dream is to build a primary school in our community, in an area where the need of it is very high. See our future primary school project to know more about it.</p>

                        <p>In our community and generally in all Uganda, women depend on their husbands in many social and economic decisions, sometimes not even being able to work outside their homes. Empowering women socially and economically is our daily work at Ride 4 a Woman, and it is the best way we know to achieve gender equality in our community. In our center, all the women find a space of safety, where they can speak aloud and get support among the others. Moreover, apart from providing employment and a safety space for the women, we have a specific program to fight domestic violence; we educate on family planning and reproductive health and rights; we skill women in sewing, weaving, agriculture practices and basic financials; and we provide spiritual guidance.</p>
                        <p>We are extremely proud to see how confident the women who are supported by Ride 4 a Woman are in their daily lives compared to the time when they started coming to our center. Little by little, they are becoming the leaders of the community.</p>
                        <p>Gender equality is very important not only for the women that we support with our social projects, but also for our staff members, the people who, through their work, make Ride 4 a Woman possible.</p>

In our community, improved water sources are not very accessible to everyone, so many people are exposed to water-borne diseases. Since 2015, in Ride 4 a Woman we have 5 water purifying filters that provide us with safe water. Moreover, from time to time, we supply jerrycans to families around the community, and we encourage everyone to come to our center and get safe water. It is very common to see children at Ride 4 a Woman every day after school filling their jerrycans with water from the purifying filters to take home before dinner time.</p>

More than 210 women have benefited from this program since it started in 2017, who had the chance to make their personal and professional projects a reality.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, we care about offering good working conditions, training and economic remuneration to all our staff, and we welcome students who are interested in doing their internships with us, giving them the opportunity to learn and be considered for the future, once they finalize their studies.

In Ride 4 a Woman, we have an agriculture program called "Seeds of grace" in which twice a year, before the beginning of the two annual rainy seasons, we provide seeds, tools and training to 120 women, so they can harvest their lands and assure food for their families. Moreover, every woman receiving the seeds and training has the duty to bud another woman of her village to keep spreading the acquired skills through the community.</p>

In Ride 4 a Woman we believe that protecting the forests is crucial, so we work for the conservation of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, its mountain gorillas and other wildlife. We partner with Ugandan Wildlife Authority (UWA) and support the park headquarters, in Buhoma, by welcoming, entertaining and bringing local tea, coffee and other meals to the park visitors and employees. Moreover, every time we can, we spread the word about the importance of conservation for both the planet and the people.</p>
